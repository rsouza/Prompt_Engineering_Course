    "cameroon = \"\"\"The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global shocks provoked by the war in Ukraine have hit African countries hard, denting economic growth and aggravating their sovereign debt positions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that Cameroon, a Central African oil producer, will record 4.3% economic growth this year after it slumped to 0.5% in 2020. The Fund has classified Cameroon as being at high risk of debt distress, though in its most recent review of the country's loan programme it stated that, with active fiscal reforms and management, the debt could be sustainable. \"Our debt service coverage from exports needs to be improved. That's the reason why we are ranked in a high risk debt distress position,\" said Alamine Ousmane Mey, Cameroon's minister of economy, planning and regional development. He was speaking at an event organised by the Atlantic Council think tank on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank's Spring Meetings in Washington. \"We're working to be able to improve our exports through import substitution policies to reduce imports, produce more and export more. This will give us better room for debt service coverage,\" he said. Cameroon has also relaunched talks with the U.S. to end its suspension from the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) initiative, which grants qualifying African countries tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Former President Donald Trump suspended Cameroon from the programme in late 2019 over \"persistent gross violations of internationally recognised human rights\" by Cameroonian security forces. Since 2017, factions of secessionist militias have been battling government troops in the majority Francophone country's two English-speaking regions. The conflict has killed thousands and displaced nearly 800,000 people. \"All the issues that have been raised, we're working on in a very transparent open manner to be able to iron them out and solve the problems,\" Mey said, referring to the talks with U.S. officials to rejoin AGOA.

    "brazil = \"\"\"Brazil's inflation likely stayed high in March on rising gasoline bills, reigniting cost of living problems in the country's stagnant economy and probably stoking more disagreement over policy, a Reuters poll showed. Consumer prices cooled in the second half of 2022 in reaction to an aggressive tightening campaign by the central bank. But inflation pressures reemerged after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office at the start of this year. The monthly report on consumer prices scheduled for Tuesday could again push back expectations for policy easing towards the end of this year and reinforce Lula's view the Bank's hawkish approach is proving ineffective. The benchmark consumer price index IPCA increased 0.77% in March, according to the median estimate of 13 economists polled March 29-April 3. This would stand very close to the 0.84% rate in February, which had been the quickest in 10 months. \"Food inflation should remain at low levels for this time of the year... (but) the partial resumption of federal taxes on gasoline and ethanol on March 1 will take a toll in the March IPCA,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report. The reinstatement of taxes on fuels already tinged March mid-month inflation figures, which came in higher than forecast, dampening any expectations Banco Central do Brasil may begin to cut its benchmark rate, currently at 13.75%, in the short term. The 12-month reading for last month is seen at 4.70%, under 5.60% in February and the lowest in more than two years due to base effects. Brazil's IBGE statistics agency will publish the data on Tuesday at 0900 local time (1200 GMT). A 0.77% inflation rate in March would result in a cumulative 2.2% clip in the first quarter, well on course to surpass this year's goal of 3.25% with a margin of 1.5 percentage points. Last week Lula hinted the government may seek changes in the target to allow for rate cuts sooner, an idea central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto - a member of a committee that sets the goal - has rejected. The panel is comprised by the bank's chief and the ministers of finance and planning, who think the fuel tax and other revenue-boosting planned measures will help lower inflation by eventually closing the primary deficit.

More and more Argentines are finding themselves in a difficult financial situation as the country’s inflation clocked in at an annual rate of 102.5% in February. Although the country has been used to double-digit inflation for years, this marked the first time the annual rise in consumer prices reached triple digits since 1991.

    "facc = \"\"\"Nach geprüften Zahlen erzielte FACC einen Umsatz von 607,0 Mio. Euro und damit rund 7 Mio. Euro mehr als Ende Februar avisiert (+22,0% yoy). Damit erreicht das Unternehmen die Guidance und kann von den steigenden Produktionsraten aller Flugzeug-OEMs profitieren. In Q4 verzeichnete das Unternehmen demnach einen deutlichen Erlösanstieg von 34,5% yoy, der auch auf hohe Kundenzahl-ungen im Zusammenhang mit Entwicklungsdienstleistungen im Schlussquartal zurückzu-führen ist. Mit einem Top Line Wachstum von 40,3% yoy auf Ganzjahressicht trug das Segment Aerostructures den Löwenteil zum Wachstum bei (235,1 Mio. Euro). Auch das im Umbau befindliche Segment mit Innenausstattungen konnte um 21,3% yoy zulegen (274,6 Mio. Euro). Das Geschäft mit Triebwerksbauteilen („Engines & Nacelles“) wies mit 6,1% yoy eine rückläufige Top-Line auf (97,3 Mio. Euro). Ursächlich hierfür war der auf Sicherheits-mängel zurückzuführende temporäre Auslieferungsstopp von Boeing 787-Maschinen. Alle Segmente mit positivem EBIT-Beitrag: Das EBIT von 5,5 Mio. Euro liegt ebenfalls etwas oberhalb des vorab kommunizierten Wertes von 5,0 Mio. Euro. Damit kehrt FACC nach den starken Beeinträchtigungen der Corona-Pandemie auf operativer Ebene auf den Profitabilitätspfad zurück, wenngleich dies eine Verfehlung des avisierten zweistelligen EBITs darstellt. Erfreulich ist die Rückkehr des Segmentes Cabin Interiors zu einem positiven EBIT-Beitrag von 1,0 Mio. Euro (Marge: 0,4%; Vj.: -2,3%). Mit einer Marge von 1,7% (Vj.: -17,0%) war das Segment Aerostructures das profitabelste Geschäftsfeld. Die Profitabilität bei Engines & Nacelles war durch den Sondereffekt im Zusammenhang mit dem 787-Lieferstopp beeinträchtigt (0,5%; Vj.: 8,4%). Durch die hohen Meilensteinzahlungen für Entwicklungstätigkeiten in Q4 fiel der Free Cashflow auf Konzernebene mit -0,07 Euro je Aktie deutlich besser aus als von uns erwartet (-0,74 Euro). Fortsetzung des Erholungskurses in 2023 erwartet: Für 2023 avisiert FACC weiterhin von den steigenden Produktionsraten der OEMs profitieren zu können und Umsatz und EBIT zu steigern. Diese bewusst allgemein formulierte Guidance ist u.E. auf die hohe Unsicherheit in der Lieferkette zurückzuführen, die sich u.a. in der bisher geringen Lieferrate von Airbus manifestiert. Mit 66 Auslieferungen (Stand: Februar) liegt Airbus deutlich hinter dem Vorjahreswert von 79 (-16,5%). Ergebnisseitig hat FACC Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die signifikant gestiegenen Bezugspreise zu kompensieren. So dürften diese durch Preiserhöhungen im Jahresverlauf an Kunden teilweise weitergereicht werden. Außerdem erwarten wir in 2023 weitere Kosteneinsparungen i.H.v. ca. 4,0 Mio. Euro durch die nach Kroatien verlagerte Produktion des Segmentes Cabin Interiors (2022: ca. 1,5 Mio. Euro).\"\"\"\n",
